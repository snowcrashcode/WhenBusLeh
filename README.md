# WhenBusLeh
An accessible and quick telegram bot that checks when is my bus going to come.

### Problem background
 I wanted to optimize the time I leave my house, so that when I can immediately board the bus at the bus stop without any waiting time. Of course there are already bus apps available on the market, but....

### Learning outcomes
 (1) I learn how to write a telegram bot, including the Python syntax, how to link APIs' and API keys, etc.. 
 (2) It's more convenient to accomplish the task (of checking bus timings) on Telegram rather than a separate app, since I already will check my Telegram for other stuff (rather than having to open up another app for the express purpose of checking bus timings)

Perhaps in the future, I will explore the possibility of adding even more features/create more telegram bots for other purposes.

### Tasklist
- [x] Implement main, start, get_bus_timing functions
- [x] Get API keys from LTA, and save as env variables so that they can be used in the code
- [x] Implement bus function
- [x] Implement template for help function
- [x]  Get bus_timing function to work
- []  Implement the actual help commands - how to use /start
- []  Implement a get_bus_code function whereby it searches for the user's nearest bus stop and grabs the bus code
